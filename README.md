<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[North Loop Demo](https://nams.terminalbytes.com)

This project integrates with Yahoo's finance API(s) via RapidApi.

### Built With
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### API(s)
1. `Get Analysis`: Gets analysis of an underlying stock by symbol.
   
2. `Get News`: Gets the latest news of a stock by symbol. Please Note: This API is deprecated by RapidAPI but I have implemented as per the requirement.
   
### Features
- `Caching`: RapidAPI has a latency of around 4-5s, to circumvent that the API responses from RapidAPI are cached for 5 minutes (unless explicitly bypassed).

- `WebSocket`: Backend logs are displayed on the right text box in real time via a websocket transport for the underlying logger.
